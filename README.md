The WWS is a large consortium of social survey data from around 100 regions across 6 waves (1981-1984, 1990-1994, 1995-1998, 1999-2004, 2005-2009 and 2010-2017).  The data consist of scores based on questionnaire covering a broad range of topicssuch as economic development, democratization, religion, gender equality, social capital,and subjective well-being. We use a subset of the data for our analysis. The relevant files which contains the code for this analysis are also included.
